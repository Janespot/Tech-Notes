___
#### To be prepared for a future filled with AI:

1.  Educate Yourself about AI
	- Learn the Basics of AI
		- Know the difference between `Real` and `Hype`
		- Learn basics of:
			- Data Science
			- Machine Learning
			- Deep Learning 
			- Reinforcement Learning
		- Learn Types of AI
	- Choose an Objective with AI e.g.
		- Automating Tasks with AI Models
		- Solving Problems with AI software
		- Being more Productive with AI Tools
	- Get the Right Training
		- `AI Trainer = Data Science + Machine Learning`
		- `AI Dev = Programming + Pre-Trained Models`
		- `AI User = AI Literacy + AI tools`
	- Practice your Skills e.g.
		- Kaggle Competitions
		- Open-Source Projects
		- Low-Risk Projects
	- Choose Reliable Sources of Information
		**Avoid:**
		- Hucksters
		- Charlatans
		- Snake Oil
		**Trust**
		- Credentials
		- Qualifications
		- Experience
2. Upgrade your Career for AI
	- Determine if your Job is at Risk i.e. 
		`high risk: simple, repetitive, dangerous, error-prone, expensive`
		`low risk: complex, creative, strategic, compassionate, uniquely human`
		`normal risk: many tasks automated, some human tasks remain`
	- Determine if your Company is at Risk
		`Traditional vs Automated tools`
		`Guesswork vs data-driven`
		`Old model vs disruptive`
	- Choose AI Career Path
		- `AI Model Trainer`
		- `AI Application Developer`
		- `AI Tool User`
	- Get into AI Value Stream
		- `AI Horizontals e.g. companies that deal with: IoT, Big Data, Robotics e.t.c`
		- `AI Verticals e.g. companies that deal with: lots of data, AI Products, AI Services`
	- Focus on Human Aspects i.e. avoid automatable tasks e.g. simple and repetitive and prefer human skills e.g. compassion and creativity
3. Invest in an AI-first Economy
4. Use AI responsibly and Ethically
5. Adapt to what Comes Next
